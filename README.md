# Emocore
EmoCore is a runtime governance layer that enforces hard behavioral bounds in autonomous agents.  Agents don’t fail because they’re dumb. They fail because nothing governs how long they’re allowed to act.  EmoCore does not improve reasoning, alignment, or performance. It defines when execution must halt  even if the agent wants to continue.
